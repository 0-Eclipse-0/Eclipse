# Eclipse
##### The Worlds Most Complex Markup Language

### Description

EML is a markup language that allows for the conversion of textile documents to be
converted to HTML format. It's complex syntax makes for an excellent markup language that
developers can use to sharpen their skills or just to play around with. The language is based
off of Markdown. It is more feature rich and up-to-date than Markdown.

### Disclaimer
EML isn't intended for users who are starting to code. It is for web developers who are
looking for a challenge that markup languages like HTML can't give them. That doesn't
mean you shouldn't give it a try if you aren't a very good developer. After all, it's better
face harder things than to face easy things because if you don't most likely you will never get
better or at least you won't get better as fast as you could.
